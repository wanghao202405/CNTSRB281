# CNTSRB281

### Introduction
According to GB/5768.2-2022 and real-world scenarios, the three major categories of traffic signs, namely warning, prohibition and indication, are further subdivided into 281 subcategories.  Then, based on the annotation files of the TT100K, CCTSDB, and TSDD datasets, the existing traffic sign images are extracted and reclassified and annotated according to the 281 sign categories.  For the newly added traffic signs that are missing in the existing datasets (such as no-electric bicycle signs), the TSGAN method was used to construct the traffic sign images of these categories, ensuring that there are at least 500 instance images for each category.Thus, a traffic sign classification dataset CNTSRB281.
